Here I want to discuss something related to my project, I automate one website and have successfully automated around more than 100 test cases.

In any case, when I go to execute all automated script, at each endeavor generally 5-6 test cases gets fizzled and purpose behind disappointment test scripts are "org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Error figuring out whether component is shown (WARNING: The server did not give any stacktrace data)". 

On executing the fizzled script exclusively it gets passed. 

It will be extremely helpful to me on the off chance that you can recommend me by what method would I be able to alter this issue.
